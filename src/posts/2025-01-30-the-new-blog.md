After a long break, I finally got some spare time to revive this blog! I realized that one of the factors that stopped 
me from writing more often was the complex way I had structured it before. It used to be a Go app running on a 
dedicated droplet, with custom code to convert Markdown into HTMLâ€¦ (Donâ€™t ask!)

Now, this first post in the new old blog still uses Markdown, but with SvelteKit, TypeScript, and Vercel! Here, for 
starters, Iâ€™m going to briefly describe my current setup.

## Brief Summary

For those of you who don't want to waste too much time, here is a brief summary of tools used to run this blog:

1. SvelteKit (full stack),
2. TypeScript for endpoints and page rendering, 
3. Markdown + Svelte components for posts, 
4. Vercel for hosting, and
5. [GitHub for the repository](https://github.com/devforfu/newblog).

That's it!

## Previous Iterations

First of all, Iâ€™m not a front-end or full-stack developer, but a machine learning engineer and data scientist. 
Therefore, I donâ€™t have much expertise in building web apps, even though Iâ€™ve created some with simple JavaScript and 
Python using Flask or FastAPI backends.

My first attempts included Jekyll templates and a Go backend with some basic JavaScript on the front end, without any 
frontend framework whatsoever, hosted on DigitalOcean (DO) in a custom Docker container.

It worked, but making changes was incredibly time-consuming. I didnâ€™t have any CI/CD pipeline or anything like that, 
and each change had to be first pushed to GitHub, then manually pulled to the DO droplet via an SSH connectionâ€¦

This manual effort â€” and the cognitive load associated with it â€” significantly slowed down updates and even the 
desire to push anything here. It was just too complex!

I decided that a new approach was necessary. For a seasoned web developer, it might sound silly, but I discovered the 
benefits of full-stack development. :)

## Full-Stack

So, as mentioned earlier, I switched to running a SvelteKit-based app on Vercel, with TypeScript as the scripting 
language and Markdown for the posts. Markdown is the same format I adopted many years ago, as itâ€™s very straightforward 
and almost like plain-text writing.

One great change, though, is that now I can integrate Svelte components right here.

This might open opportunities for nice interactive visualizations, if I manage to create some.

The components' source code is written directly in the codeblock of the Markdown file and rendered using great 
[`mdsvex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdsvex) preprocessor.

## Up and running!

The blog was refreshed quite quickly, thanks to some knowledge of SvelteKit Iâ€™ve gained over the last couple of years, 
great online tutorials, and a bit of LLM-driven code generation. ðŸ¤–

A side effect of this work is that the barrier for publishing new notes and posts feels significantly lower 
now â€” for better or worseâ€¦
