description: An application of a simple neural network based recommendation system to the MovieLens dataset 
---

<!--preamble-->

Recently Iâ€™ve started watching [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai) lectures --- a great
online course on Deep Learning. In one of his lectures, the author
discusses the building of a simple neural network based recommendation system
with application to the MovieLens dataset. The lecture relies on
the library developed by the author to run the training process. However,
I strongly wanted to learn more about the **PyTorch** framework which sits
under the hood of authors code. In this post, I am describing the process 
of implementing and training a simple embeddings-based collaborative filtering 
recommendation system using **PyTorch**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-Learn**.
