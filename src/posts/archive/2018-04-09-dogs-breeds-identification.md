description: Using Keras and pre-trained deep learning models to classify dog breeds
---

<!--preamble-->

Modern deep learning architectures show quite good results in various fields of
artificial intelligence. One of them is images classification. In this post,
I am going to see if one could achieve an accurate classification of images by
applying out-of-the-box [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/) pre-trained deep
models from [Keras](http://keras.io/) Python package.
