<!--preamble-->

Clustering algorithms are used to analyze the data in an unsupervised fashion, in
cases when the labels are not available, or to get the new insights about the dataset.
The K-Means algorithm is one of the oldest clustering algorithms developed
several decades ago but still applied in modern Machine Learning tasks. One of the ways
to use this algorithm is to apply it for _vector quantization_ --- a process allowing
to reduce the dimensionality of analyzed data. In this post, I'm going to
implement a simple version of K-Means and apply it to [Wrist-worn Accelerometer Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dataset+for+ADL+Recognition+with+Wrist-worn+Accelerometer).

## K-Means Algorithm

The K-means clustering is a simple and elegant approach for partitioning a dataset
into **K** distinct, non-overlapping clusters. The algorithm implementation
can be easily formulated as the following pseudocode shows.

<blockquote class="algo">
  <ol>    
    <li>
      Assign random labels from range <Katex math={`1...K`} /> to each observation in
      dataset to get an initial partitioning.
    </li>
    <li>
      For each of <Katex math={`K`} /> clusters, compute the cluster <em>centroid</em> which is
      the vector of <em>p</em> feature means for the observations in the
      <strong><em>k</em></strong>th cluster. (In other words, each cluster's centroid is
      an average of vectors assigned to the cluster).
    </li>
    <li>
      Assign each observation to the cluster whose centroid is closest in
      terms of <em>Euclidian distance</em> metric.
    </li>
    <li>If clusters assignment was changed, go to <strong>step 2</strong></li>
    <li>Return calculated cluster centroids and assigned labels.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

Note that the algorithm uses the Euclidean metric to measure the similarity between
data points. It means that each dimension is considered to be **equally important**
to distinguish one sample from the another. Therefore, it is crucial to normalize
your dataset before running the algorithm.

**Figure 1** shows an animated process of K-Means clustering of a randomly
generated dataset, where each cluster is rendered with a different color.
While the algorithm iterates through its loop, the centroids slowly change 
their positions until there are no re-assignments anymore.

</div>

Because of the random generation of the initial centroids, it is a good idea to
run the algorithm several times and choose the best clusters assignment. Which
assignment is the best? For this purpose, one could use an **inertia metric** that
is defined as a total distance from the samples to their clusters' centroids as the 
equation below shows:

<Katex math={`I = \\sum\_{j = 1}^{K}{ \\sum\_{\\substack{i = 1 \\ x\_i \\in C\_j}}^{N}{ d(x\_i, c\_j)} }`} displayMode=true />

Where: 
* <Katex math={`K`} /> is a number of clusters,
* <Katex math={`N`} /> is a number of observations,
* <Katex math={`C\_j`} /> is a set of observations belonging to the cluster <Katex math={`j`} />, and 
* <Katex math={`c_j`} /> &mdash; the centroid of the <Katex math={`j`} />th cluster. This measure of clustering quality 
shows how close the dataset observations are to the centers of their clusters.

In next section, we're going to implement K-Means clustering using the `numpy` library.

## Implementation with NumPy

The full source code with K-Means clustering implementation is located
[there](https://github.com/devforfu/Blog/blob/master/kmeans/kmeans.py).
In this section let's highlight the key points of the algorithm.

To implement the main loop of K-Means clustering, we need a function that accepts
a dataset, a number of clusters `K` a, and a couple of additional
parameters to specify how many restarts of the algorithm do we want to perform to
find the best clustering assignment.

<Gist gistId="43e1a43054bd22081b71083d66ca0464"></Gist>

The dataset normalization requires us to subtract the mean of dataset values
from every sample and divide it by a standard deviation. To generate random
centroids, we can use one of the random generators from `numpy.random` module.
Calculating an inertia metric is also quite simple using `numpy` and its
filtering and linear algebra functions.

Before proceeding to the quantization algorithm, here is an important remark. Despite
of the fact that the implementation of K-Means algorithm provided in this post's
repository is totally functional and does its job, it is quite far away from the
production-ready code. Check [this link](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py)
from the `scikit-learn` library showing handling various edge cases and making the code
much faster than this naïve implementation, including [fragments](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/cluster/_k_means.pyx)
written in [Cython](http://cython.org/) to achieve the higher performance.

## Vectors Quantization

Before being used in the data mining for cluster analysis, the algorithm was originally
used in the field of signal processing as a method of **vectors quantization** (VQ).
The VQ is a data reduction method that means it seeks to reduce the number
of dimensions in the input data so that the models used to match the unknowns can
be as simple as possible.

Quantization allows transforming continuous values into the discrete buckets. **Figure 2**
shows a 2D plane filled with **blue** dots representing the values of random continuous
real vectors. To discretize this space into a finite number of buckets, we can
plot a grid on top of the plane with the blue dots and replace every blue dot with a **red**
one which is the center of a grid cell where the blue dot falls.

<div class="image-container">
    <img class="image" src="/images/posts/dots.png" alt="dots">
    <em class="image-title">Fig 2. Continuous 2D points discretized into buckets</em>
</div>

The K-Means algorithm allows us to do exactly this. Each centroid vector could
be treated as a center of a "grid cell", and can be used as a "discretized"
representation of the vectors in proximity. But in the case of K-Means, the
quantized vectors could have much more dimensions and the "cells" are not in 2D, but
are generally in the `N`-dimensional space.

Next section shows how this idea can be used to convert observation vectors of
an arbitrary length into a fixed-size feature vectors.

## Applying K-Means to Accelerometer Data

Consider the following use case. You have a dataset with accelerometer
measurements. Each measurement is saved into a separate text file and is
represented by a sequence of `(x, y, z)` coordinates. Also, each measurement
belongs to one of `M` activity types, like `PourWater` or `Walk`. To convert
this dataset into something suitable for a machine learning algorithm
(SVM, decision tree, logistic regression or anything else), one needs to read
measurements from files and concatenate their coordinates into feature vectors.

But what if each file contains an _arbitrary number of coordinates_, i.e.
its length is not predefined? That is exactly the case of the [Wrist-worn Accelerometer Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dataset+for+ADL+Recognition+with+Wrist-worn+Accelerometer)
mentioned at the beginning of this post as the **Figure 3** shows.

<div class="image-container">
    <img class="image" src="/images/posts/num_of_files_hist.png" alt="hist">
    <em class="image-title">Fig 3. Histogram of most common file lengths</em>
</div>

It is not possible to concatenate the measurements together because then each
feature vector would have a different length. But K-Means clustering can help us 
to overcome this issue and prepare the dataset for classification. The process of
mapping from an arbitrary length accelerometer observations array into a
fixed-size feature vector is schematically shown in the **Figure 4**.

<div class="image-container">
    <img class="image" src="/images/posts/kmeans_quantization.png" alt="quant">
    <em class="image-title">Fig 4. Using K-Means to create fixed-size feature vectors</em>
</div>

Every of `N` dataset's files should be parsed into a matrix of accelerometer
measurements with shape `(Mi, 3)` where `Mi` is the `i`th file length.
Then, the clustering algorithm with `K` clusters should be applied to
**every of these matrices, separately**. Finally, the centroids calculated for every
matrix should be concatenated into 1-dimensional feature vectors with length
`K * 3`, and then stacked together into the final matrix of
size `(N, K * 3)`.

The following snippet shows how this processes looks in the code.

The project with full implementation of the functions described in this post
could be found via [this link](https://github.com/devforfu/Blog/tree/master/kmeans)
alongside with the aforementioned dataset and a couple of helper utilities.

## Conclusion

The K-Means algorithm is a simple but powerful clustering technique that
should have its place in every machine learning engineer's toolkit. It could be
applied not only in an unsupervised learning setting to discover the patterns of
an analyzed dataset but also to reduce the dimensionality of the considered
problem.

Though it is simple to implement this method from scratch, it is
better to use a robust, scalable and well-tested solution instead, like this
[scikit-learn implementation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) 
that takes into account various edge cases and improvements.
