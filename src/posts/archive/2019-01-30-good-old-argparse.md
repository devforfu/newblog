<!--preamble-->

The Python programming language is quite often used to write various CLI-based utilities and 
automation tools. There are plenty of third-party libraries that make this process very easy and 
straightforward. However, recently I've realized that very often I use the good old `argparse` when 
writing my snippets, and also there are many legacy projects that utilize this package. That's 
why I've decided to create a single reference point for myself showing how to use it. In this post,
we are going to take a close look at the library and gradually build a simple CLI to generate plots 
with `matplotlib` library.

## Third-Party Solutions

Before we dive into the `argparse` capabilities, let's have a quick overview of the third-party libraries 
and their unique properties. In this way we can understand what is available in the more sophisticated 
libraries, and compare the amount of efforts required to achieve the similar results with the 
built-in package.

libraries but to have some reference point for the comparison with the standard library. Please
refer to the documentation to know more about the packages discussed below.

### Fire

Sometimes the CLI is not the purpose per se but only a method to 
run the code you've written. For example, you have a class that makes some plotting 
but has no standalone interface and is intended to be used as a part of other programs only. 
The [`fire`](https://github.com/google/python-fire) helps you to easily convert the class 
into a CLI tool.

<Gist gistId="c8677316dcbf69f70718a0dc4f702fc8" />

That's all! Now you can invoke the class like the line below shows:
```
$ python plotter.py scatter plot 1 2 3 4 5 6
```
An easy solution to expose your code to the command-line interaction in cases 
when you don't want to spend too much time building the argument parser manually.

### Docopt
Whenever you develop a CLI-based tool, you would like to make it well-document 
so the users can understand how to use it. Therefore, you don't only write the 
command-line parsing code but also the strings explaining how it works. 
The [`docopt`](http://docopt.org) package makes your job a bit easier: you only
need to write a proper README for your program, and the package generates the 
argument parser for you.

<Gist gistId="96a7897d8ec0cb52df8d10a8a784df52" />

In this case, we also need to write a small snippet to pass the parsed arguments 
into the plotter class. However, now the CLI and the execution logic are much better 
decoupled from each other. We can define an interface that is different from our 
methods signatures and adapt the parsed arguments later. Use [this link](http://try.docopt.org) 
to try it yourself right from the browser.

### Click

The last third-party solution we're going to discuss here is the [`click`](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) 
package. The library is closer to the common programmatic solutions to build arguments parsers.
You need to explicitly write the parsing logic in the form of function decorators.

<Gist gistId="2bb9e1256e7edc09dd8cc9655178a599" />

The library is more verbose than the previous solutions but it is also very flexible and powerful. 
It supports various arguments types, sub-commands, passing the argument context from one decorated 
function into another, and many other convenient and helpful things. This option I use the most 
often if don't want to go with `argparse` for some reason.

Now when we discussed the possible alternatives to standard library solutions, let's check 
how the "native" Python's approach works, and what we can achieve using `argparse`.

## The First Glance

Let's pick the same idea that was shown in the previous section and implement a simple CLI to 
generate scatter plots. We're going to start with basic usage of `argparse` capabilities 
and gradually increase the complexity to show more sophisticated behavior. 
The program we're going to write should do the following:

1. Accept a list of points
2. Render a scatter plot
3. Allow adjusting canvas properties
4. Save the result into one of the supported formats

The snippet below shows one possible implementation of the required capabilities.

<Gist gistId="552fa92e514d5f9ebde4fb3051503992" />

Lines **6-39** show arguments parsing logic. Here we explicitly define the expected types and 
properties of the arguments. Lines **41-50** implement a super simple scatter plot rendering logic.
There is a couple of interesting keyword arguments we use. The first of them is `dest`. 
By default, each parsed parameter is saved into an `args` object under the property with the 
same name. For example, if we have a `-p` parameter, the parser stores it as `args.p`, or if there 
is a parameter called `--size`, it becomes `args.size` property. The `dest` keyword allows us to 
override this behavior and save the parsed parameter with a more verbose property name. 

Another one is called `metavar` and defines how the parser renders the help message. Again, 
the default choice is the name of a parameter. If the name is long, it could take a lot of screen 
space, so we're using shorter abbreviations to keep the help message less cluttered. 

Finally, the `choices` parameter allows us to define the parameters that can take their values from a restricted set only.

Probably we didn't write the best scatter plots rendering program ever, but it does what we need. Can we do something better here?

## Checking Types

As you could spot at the line **41**, we convert raw string argument into a list of real-valued points. 
Also, the line **42** converts canvas size from a string into a tuple. These fragments of code don't 
have too much relation to our rendering logic. We have only two of them, but more sophisticated programs 
could include more, and having these additional post-processing lines of the code is not very convenient.

The `argparse` addresses this issue with a specific keyword parameter called `type` that accepts an 
arbitrary callable responsible for converting raw strings into concrete types. We can pass a built-in 
type constructors here, like `int` or `float`, or our custom parsing functions. Let's do the later 
and convert points and canvas size into the appropriate types. The snippet below shows an example 
of how to do so.

<Gist gistId="bbdb24d107cd818e33e2477657ed6e38" />

The critical difference from the previous snippet is in lines **9** and **15**, 
as well as the custom type functions defined in lines **54** and **69**. 
The functions take the single argument --- string-typed parameter parsed from the command line. 
Then we verify that the parameter has the valid format, and convert it into an appropriate type. 
The `ArgumentTypeError` exception is raised when something goes wrong, and the parser reports about the issue.

```bash
$ python typecheck.py -p 1 2 3 4 5 6
usage: typecheck.py [-h] -p PTS [-sz SZ] [-f FMT] [-o OUT] [--hide-axes]
                    [--show-grid]
typecheck.py: error: argument -p/--points: should have format: 1,2;2,3;3,4
$ python typecheck.py -p "1,2;3,4;5,6" --size 22
usage: typecheck.py [-h] -p PTS [-sz SZ] [-f FMT] [-o OUT] [--hide-axes]
                    [--show-grid]
typecheck.py: error: argument -sz/--size: should have format: 3x4
```

Great! Now we have a parser that is aware of our domain-specific types and shows an 
informative message when something goes wrong.

## Adding The Sub-Commands

Our plotter can only read the input from the terminal. It would be great to add 
the support of additional input sources, for example --- JSON files. We can 
define all the rendering parameters within a single file instead of passing them 
as CLI parameters. The only parameter we need here is a path to the JSON file. 
However, in our current implementation the `points` parameter is required. 
The renderer that reads its parameters from the terminal cannot do its work without 
at least one point. 

We don't need this parameter in case of JSON. How can we make so that the parser 
can handle both these cases smoothly without any hacking with the parameters? The answer is to use _sub-commands_.
The `argparse` allows you to build not only a single god-object parser that includes every possible parameter 
but define _a hierarchy of parsers_ instead where every parser is only responsible for the set of arguments 
relevant to a specific command. The code says more than thousands of words. The below snippet shows how we
can implement such a hierarchical parser.

<Gist gistId="1760a3e9c94c45ad04d9a94e9eece2a0" />

We've reordered our code a bit, but the major differences are in the lines **45**, **52**, and **81**.
The line **45** shows how to create a subgroup of commands attached to the main parser. 
(The parameters defined in lines **33-43** become common for all the sub-commands we're going to define). 
The lines **52** and **81** add sub-parsers for each input source, standard input and a JSON file. 
It is also worth to note the lines **53** and **83**. They allow us to distinguish one sub-command from another.
We use this default parameter in lines **11-14** to pick an appropriate set of the parameters from the parser.

## Customized Help Message

We've explored most of the helpful tricks that we can use to build a flexible and convenient CLI. 
The only thing we probably would cover is the help message formatting. 

First of all, by default the package uses a specific formatting style. 
For example, it ignores newline characters in the strings we put under `help` keywords in `add_argument`
method calls. 

Another thing is `-h/--help`  parameter that is added automatically when the parser object is created. 
If you have a parameter that starts with H letter, like `-h/--host`, you can't use a 
shortcut version of it because it is already taken by help command. 

Finally, when a user makes a mistake and passes the wrong parameters or keywords, we could show a full 
program usage message with some examples instead of telling about the mistake in that specific parameter only. 
(Which is the behavior of `argparse` by default). 

The snippet below shows the changes we need to introduce into our program to address all these issues.
```python
# create custom parser
parser = CustomParser(
    description=__doc__,
    formatter_class=argparse.RawTextHelpFormatter,
    add_help=False
)

...

# somewhere in the code
class CustomParser(ArgumentParser):

    def error(self, message):
        self.print_help()
        sys.exit(1)
```

You can find the final version of the program we've written with all the changes
by following [this link](https://gist.github.com/devforfu/f7a01e74acfffb63d2957d6231f08285).

## Conclusion

There is a plenty of command-line parsing packages written for the Python 
language. Some of them are intended to wrap your classes and functions with 
CLI quickly. Others are more involved and give you a sophisticated solution. 
Nevertheless, the standard `argparse` module is still a very helpful and the most 
portable solution. As soon as you've learned its capabilities and tricks, 
it becomes a universal and straightforward tool to write CLI scripts with 
of various levels of complexity.
