description: A simple solution to the Career Con 2019 data competition using PyTorch
---

<!--preamble-->

The [Career Con 2019 data competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/career-con-2019) 
was all about time series classification. This kind of problems seem to be a great 
choice to apply Deep Learning models. However, even deep models cannot magically 
give you good results if the data wasn't properly prepared. In this notebook, 
we're going to build a simple solution based on one of the winning kernels using 
PyTorch to classify a type of surface using sensor measurements of a small 
mobile robot.
