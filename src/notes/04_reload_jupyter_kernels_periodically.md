Jupyter keeps everything in the global scope. Every variable or function that was defined
during a session is stored until explicitly deleted or the kernel is reloaded. Of course,
each imported module and function sits in the scope as well. Therefore, it is a good
habit to reload the kernel every once in a while. Especially, before committing the
results into version control system or running a scheduled job.
